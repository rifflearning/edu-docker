# override/additions to docker-compose.yml for production
# - the image names are set for deploying to a registry service running
#   on a local swarm (or tunneled into a swarm manager in the cloud)
# - the defaults in this file should be overridden to more strictly define
#   what is built and deployed, but are reasonable values.
#   - uses prod Dockerfile for riff-server & signalmaster from a ref in the github repo
#     use these env vars to override the git ref (ie use a specific version
#     instead of master):
#     - RIFF_SERVER_REF
#     - SIGNALMASTER_REF
#   - edu-riffdata (riff-server) has all files needed copied to the image
#   - tags edu-mm, edu-riffdata & edu-signalmaster images w/ "latest" by default,
#     use these env vars to override:
#     - EDU_MM_TAG
#     - RIFF_SERVER_TAG
#     - SIGNALMASTER_TAG
